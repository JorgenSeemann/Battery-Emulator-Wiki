# Compatible Emulator Hardware

There are many hardware kits that can run the Battery-Emulator software. Amount of stars ⭐ signal how easy to use the hardware is for a newcomer:

!!! info "NOTE"
    There is no way to purchase a pre-programmed device. This is a hobbyist open source project. You will be responsible for loading the software and setting it up correctly for your components. There is however a [support Discord group](https://www.patreon.com/dala) available.

## Small flash boards { #small-flash-boards }

The [LilyGo T-CAN485](lilygo_t_can485.md) and the [ESP32 DevKit](esp32_devkit_v1.md) have only 4 MB of flash, so their firmware is built without some features to make room for the rest. 

??? quote "Reduced features"
    | Feature | On a small flash board |
    |---|---|
    | [MG 5](../battery/mg5_marvel_r.md) battery | Not offered in the battery list |
    | [Degradation reset for Nissan LEAF](../battery/nissan_leaf_e_nv200.md#performing-the-reset) | No reset button, the LEAF battery itself works |
    | [CHAdeMO V2X](../battery/wip/chademo_vehicle.md) battery, with its CT clamp and IVT shunt support | Not offered in the battery list |
    | "Custom Clamp" shunt | Not offered in the shunt list |
    | [Chargebyte CCS V2X](../battery/wip/ccs_bidirectional_charging.md) battery | Not offered in the battery list |
    | `<hostname>.local` address (mDNS) | Reach the board by its IP address instead |
    | I2C display (SSD1306) | Not offered for the configurable port |
    | Built-in help texts of the [Settings page](../setup/software/webserver_guide.md#settings) | Shown only when the browser has Internet access |
    | Built-in DTC descriptions on the battery pages | Shown only when the browser has Internet access |
    | RS485 driver-enable (DE) pin control | Not driven, matters only for an RS485 transceiver that needs it |

## Status LED 🟢

Some boards has a built in LED that is used to signal current status. Most boards expose a GPIO pin where you can attach your own WS2812-compatible pixel you can cut off a LED strip. With this feature, it is easy to at a glance catch what info the board is getting. It will show the current colors:

* Pulses 🟢 if all is well and BMS is active
* Pulses 🟡 if battery has entered a warning state
* Solid 🔴 if battery goes into a fault state
* Pulses ⚪ when the BOOT button has [been long pressed for various tasks](../setup/software/boot_button_functions.md)

By visiting the "Events" page in the Webserver, you can see which specific warnings/faults are active.

## Connectivity 🛜

The board has wifi, and supports running a [Webserver that you can connect to for real time values](../setup/software/webserver_guide.md), [Over The Air updates](../setup/software/ota_update.md) (OTA), cellmonitoring, changing settings and more. See the [Webserver](../setup/software/webserver_guide.md) page for more info on how to use the system.

For those into [home automation](../setup/software/home_assistant.md), the code is also supports [MQTT](../setup/software/mqtt.md). 

## Optional screen via ESPNow 🖥️
No Battery-Emulator hardware comes with displays by default. If you want to add a local display to your system, the best option is to add a [ESPNow](../setup/software/espnow.md/) compatible microcontroller, which will wirelessly connect to the Battery-Emulator board and display statistics.
