title: "UUGreenPower DC/DC V2x CCS2 Charger"
---

This page provides details about the 22/25Kw charger from UUGP (UBC22K1000-Y1-CCS2D).

The benefit of this charger is that it connects (power) directly to DC, and thus reduce the conversion loss.

The charger connects to the BMS using RS485, and to the DC power cables between the battery and the inverter.

The manual can be found here: https://github.com/JorgenSeemann/Battery-Emulator-Wiki/blob/main/docs/setup/chargers/V2X%20Bidirectional%20DCDC%20EV%20Charger%20User%20Manual%20V10_260918_123745.pdf
